# 
# 6. **Tempo:**
#    - The average tempo is approximately 120.61 BPM, suggesting a moderate pace overall.
#    - Considerable variability in tempo exists, reflecting diverse rhythmic characteristics.
# 
# 7. **Duration:**
#    - The mean song duration is approximately 224,628 milliseconds, with considerable variability.
#    - Songs vary widely in duration, ranging from shorter tracks to longer compositions.
#

#    - A small portion of songs exhibit higher speechiness, indicating the presence of spoken words.
# 
# 2. **Acousticness:**
#    - The distribution seems relatively evenly spread, with a peak around lower values.
#    - There's a noticeable proportion of songs with higher acousticness, suggesting a significant acoustic component.
# 
# 3. **Instrumentalness:**
#    - The distribution is heavily skewed towards lower values, implying most songs contain vocals.
#    - Some songs are entirely instrumental, indicated by a long tail on the right side.
# 
# 4. **Liveness:**
#    - The distribution appears somewhat right-skewed, with the majority of songs having lower liveness values.
#    - Fewer songs exhibit higher liveness, indicating a smaller proportion of live recordings.
#

#    - The distribution seems relatively symmetric, centered around moderate values.
#    - There's variability in valence, with songs conveying both positive and negative emotional tones.
# 
# 6. **Tempo:**
#    - The distribution appears approximately normal, centered around a moderate tempo.
#    - Some outliers have very low or very high tempo values, but most songs fall within a moderate tempo range.

# ### Observations:
# 
# 1. **Speechiness:**
#    - The distribution of speechiness appears to be skewed towards lower values, with a few outliers having higher speechiness.
#    - Most songs in the dataset have relatively low speechiness, but there are some exceptions with higher speechiness values.
# 
# 2. **Acousticness:**
#    - The distribution of acousticness is varied, with a wide range of values.
#    - While a significant number of songs have low acousticness, indicating a higher presence of electronic or amplified sounds, there are also many songs with high acousticness, suggesting a more natural or unplugged sound.
# 
# 3. **Instrumentalness:**
#    - Most songs have low instrumentalness, indicating the presence of vocals.
#    - However, there are notable outliers with high instrumentalness, suggesting instrumental tracks or sections within songs.
# 
# 4. **Liveness:**
#    - The distribution of liveness values varies, with some songs having higher liveness indicative of live recordings or performances.
#    - However, the majority of songs have lower liveness values, suggesting studio recordings.
# 
# 5. **Valence:**
#    - The distribution of valence values appears relatively balanced, with songs conveying both positive and negative emotional tones.
#    - However, there are slightly more songs with higher valence, indicating a prevalence of positive emotions in the dataset.
# 
# 6. **Tempo:**
#    - The tempo distribution spans a wide range of values, indicating diverse rhythmic characteristics across songs.
#    - Most songs have moderate tempos, but there are outliers with both very slow and very fast tempos.
# 
# 7. **Duration_ms:**
#    - The distribution of song durations is skewed towards shorter durations, with a few outliers representing longer tracks.
#    - Most songs in the dataset are of moderate duration, but there is variability in track length.
# 
# 8. **Views, Likes, Comments, and Stream:**
#    - The box plots for these features show a wide range of values, indicating variability in song popularity and engagement metrics.
#    - There are many outliers in these distributions, representing songs with exceptionally high or low engagement levels.

# ### Observations:
# 
# 1. **Speechiness vs. Acousticness:**
#    - There appears to be a slight negative correlation between speechiness and acousticness. Songs with higher speechiness tend to have lower acousticness, and vice versa.
# 
# 2. **Instrumentalness vs. Acousticness:**
#    - There is a noticeable negative correlation between instrumentalness and acousticness. Songs with higher instrumentalness tend to have lower acousticness, indicating that instrumental tracks are less likely to be acoustic.
# 
# 3. **Valence vs. Speechiness:**
#    - There doesn't seem to be a clear correlation between valence (musical positiveness) and speechiness. Songs with varying levels of speechiness can have both positive and negative valence.
# 
# 4. **Views vs. Likes:**
#    - There is a positive correlation between the number of views and the number of likes, indicating that songs with more views tend to have more likes. However, the relationship is not linear, suggesting that other factors may influence the number of likes.
# 
# 5. **Duration vs. Tempo:**
#    - There doesn't appear to be a clear relationship between the duration of a song and its tempo. Songs of varying durations can have both slow and fast tempos.
# 
# 6. **Views vs. Comments:**
#    - Similar to views vs. likes, there is a positive correlation between the number of views and the number of comments. Songs with more views tend to have more comments, but the relationship is not linear.
